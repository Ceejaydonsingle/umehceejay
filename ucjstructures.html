                The relationship between money and happiness is surprisingly
                weak, which may stem in part from the way people spend it. Drawing on
                empirical research, we propose eight principles designed to help
                consumers get more happiness for their money. Specifically, we suggest
                that consumers should (1) buy more experiences and fewer material
                goods; (2) use their money to benefit others rather than themselves;
                (3) buy many small pleasures rather than fewer large ones; (4) eschew
                extended warranties and other forms of overpriced insurance; (5) delay
                consumption; (6) consider how peripheral features of their purchases
                may affect their day-to-day lives; (7) beware of comparison shopping;
                and (8) pay close attention to the happiness of others.

                    Scientists have studied the relationship between money and
                happiness for decades and their conclusion is clear: Money buys
                happiness, but it buys less than most people think (Aknin, Norton, &
                Dunn, 2009; Diener & Biswas-Diener, 2002; Frey & Stutzer, 2000). The
                correlation between income and happiness is positive but modest, and
                this fact should puzzle us more than it does. After all, money allows
                people to do what they please, so shouldn’t they be pleased when they
                spend it? Why doesn’t a whole lot more money make us a whole lot more
                happy? One answer to this question is that the things that bring
                happiness simply aren’t for sale. This sentiment is lovely, popular,
                and almost certainly wrong. Money allows people to live longer and
                healthier lives, to buffer themselves against worry and harm, to have
                leisure time to spend with friends and family, and to control the
                nature of their daily activities—all of which are sources of happiness
                (Smith, Langa, Kabeto, & Ubel, 2005). Wealthy people don’t just have
                better toys; they have better nutrition and better medical care, more
                free time and more meaningful labor—more of just about every
                ingredient in the recipe for a happy life. And yet, they aren’t that
                much happier than those who have less. If money can buy happiness, then
                why doesn’t it?

                    When people make predictions about the hedonic consequences of
                future events they are said to be making affective forecasts, and a
                sizeable literature shows that these forecasts are often wrong (for
                reviews see Gilbert & Wilson, 2007; 2009; Wilson & Gilbert, 2003).
                Errors in affective forecasting can be traced to two basic sources.
                First, people’s mental simulations of future events are almost always
                imperfect. For example, people don’t anticipate the ease with which
                they will adapt to positive and negative events, they don’t fully
                understand the factors that speed or slow that adaptation, and they
                are insufficiently sensitive to the fact that mental simulations lack
                important details. Second, context exerts strong effects on affective
                forecasts and on affective experiences, but people often fail to
                realize that these two contexts are not the same; that is, the context
                in which they are making their forecasts is not the context in which
                they will be having their experience. These two sources of error
                cause people to mispredict what will make them happy, how happy it
                will make them, and how long that happiness will last. Van Boven and Gilovich (2003) defined experiential purchases as those
                ―made with the primary intention of acquiring a life experience: an
                event or series of events that one lives through,‖ while defining
                material purchases as those ―made with the primary intention of
                acquiring a material good: a tangible object that is kept in one’s
                possession‖ (p. 1194). Although there is a ―fuzzy boundary‖ between
                these two types of purchases, with many purchases (e.g., a new car)
                falling somewhere in the hazy middle, consumers are consistently able
                to describe past purchases that clearly fit these definitions, both in
                their own minds and the minds of coders trained in this distinction
                (Carter & Gilovich, 2010, p. 156). In one study, these definitions
                were presented to a nation-wide sample of over a thousand Americans,
                who were asked to think of a material and an experiential purchase
                they had made with the intention of increasing their own happiness.
                Asked which of the two purchases made them happier, fully 57% of
                respondents reported that they had derived greater happiness from
                their experiential purchase, while only 34% reported greater happiness
                from their material purchase. Similar results emerged using a betweensubjects design in which participants were randomly assigned to
                reflect on either a material or experiential purchase they had made;
                individuals experienced elevated mood when contemplating a past
                experiential purchase (relative to those contemplating a past material
                purchase), suggesting that experiential purchases produce more lasting
                hedonic benefits.
